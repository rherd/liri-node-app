# liri-node-app

Liri is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. It uses the Twitter, Node-Spotify-API, Request, and DotEnv node packages, as well as the OMDB API to pull back songs, twitter feeds, and movie information. The app also records a log using the file system node package.

The app takes in "my-tweets", "spotify-this-song" (and an argument), "movie-this" (+ argument), and "do-what-it-says" (which allows a user to specify the commands in a text file). 

This project was completed for the GT Coding Bootcamp.
